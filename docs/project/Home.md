Based on Professor Feng Zhang's article, "Programmable Protein Delivery with a Bacterial Contractile Injection System," we utilized the extracted PVC injection system from the study and aimed to assess its ability to counteract Vibrio cholerae infection. To achieve this, we constructed the corresponding plasmid proteins and transformed them into E.coli competent cells. After expression, PVC proteins were extracted via ultracentrifugation. Once the protein was successfully obtained, we conducted bactericidal assays using spot plate experiments with V. cholerae on agar plates. We then observed the bactericidal effect of PVC on V. cholerae under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate whether PVC can serve as an effective tool for combating V. cholerae. This experiment aims to validate PVC's potential for future therapeutic applications.
